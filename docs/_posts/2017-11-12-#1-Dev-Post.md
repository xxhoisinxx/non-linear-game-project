## Introduction
Welcome back to the second development diary of this non-linear game. Last week we had some issues deciding on what our unconventional interface would be. In the end, we decided to scrap the timeline wheel and use a scrapbook of time places instead.  

The scrapbook is a physical book and each page of the scrap book represents a point in time. Our intention is to have each of these pages abstract a particular crime scene or investigation, which is concretely represented inside the game.

To connect the physical scrapbook with the game, we are using an augmented reality framework called Vuforia. Our intention is to make the game a mobile game and have a scene where the user can direct his camera at page in the scrapbook. Vuforia is able to detect this page and this will allow the user to jump between scenes in the game.

## Using Vuforia
To implement the mechanics mentioned in the introduction, I had to figure out to extract information from the different Vuforia components. Once i was able to achieve this, I used action listeners to handle a page being detected by Vuforia. 

One of the interfaces Vuforia provides you with is the `ITrackableEventHandler`. This event handler interface is triggered whenever something is detected by Vuforia.

Heres my implementation of the interface.
{% highlight csharp %}
public void OnTrackableStateChanged(
        TrackableBehaviour.Status previousStatus,
        TrackableBehaviour.Status newStatus) {
    if (newStatus == TrackableBehaviour.Status.DETECTED
            || newStatus == TrackableBehaviour.Status.TRACKED
            || newStatus == TrackableBehaviour.Status.EXTENDED_TRACKED) {
        this.scrapbookManager.newScene.Value = this.TrackableBehaviour.TrackableName;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Basically what this code does is store the name of the image detected in a field called `scrapbookManager.newScene`. This field is a reactive string property, meaning I subscribe to it and listen for when it changes. This is useful because I don't want the scene to change whenever a page is detected. Instead I want the user to be able to confirm the change with a button press and have the scene change to the most recent detected page.

Since I am listening to when the most recent detected page changes, I can use this to setup an action listener for a button that also changes. To put it more simply, whenever a page is detected, the `onclick` action for the button is changed so that when pressed, it changes to the scene with the same name as the most recent detected scene.

Here the code.
{% highlight csharp %}
this.newScene.Subscribe(
    e => {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(e)) {
            this.LoadSceneButton.interactable = false;
            return;
        }

        Log.InfoFormat("The detected new scene is {0}", e);
        this.LoadSceneButton.interactable = true;
        if (this.loadSceneButtonHandler != null) {
            this.loadSceneButtonHandlerFactory
                .Despawn(this.loadSceneButtonHandler);
        }
        this.loadSceneButtonHandler =
            this.loadSceneButtonHandlerFactory.Spawn(
                this.LoadSceneButton,
                this.newScene.Value);
    });
{% endhighlight %}

We will now take a look at it in action.

## Remarks about Vuforia
I have numerous complaints about Vuforia. The first one being, they log stuff in the Unity console and theres no way to turn it off. Second issue is the automatic injection of augmented reality into every scene, regardless of whether there is an AR camera in the scene or not.

I found a [workaround](https://forum.unity.com/threads/use-ar-camera-vuforia-core-in-individual-scene-not-entire-project.498489/#post-3262950), but it is still baffling that this is a thing.

There's also a watermark in AR scenes which is lame!
