## Introduction
---

Hello everybody, and welcome to the first development diary for our non-linear game that has yet to be named. Today, we are going to talk about the basic ideas and mechanics of our game. In addition, we will go over the current implementation of a few mechanics and discuss the current problems we are facing.  

## Game Overview
---

The basic premise of our game is to be a non-linear, story driven game. We chose this as the core theme behind our game because we wanted to explore a type of gameplay where the player is not linearly guided through the game. 

To do this, we are using the concept of time travel because it allows the player to easily jump to the different parts of game's story.

For the plot, we decided on a murder-mystery style game, where the player needs to collect clues and solve puzzles to stop a deadly serial killer. The player plays as the main character, a detective who has been troubled all his life because he was never able to solve the mystery of who that serial killer was. One day, the main character encounters a mysterious cat that gives him time traveling powers so that he can go back and solve that mystery.

## Mechanics

### Timeline Rearrangement

The player is able to time travel to different parts of the story line by rearranging the pieces of the story's circular timeline. Each of these pieces represents a point in the main character's life. The player starts in one of these pieces and moves to the next piece once they leave their current piece.

The purpose of this is to create an abstract view for the player so he can see where he is in the story and decide where he wants to move next. The actual gameplay takes place in a scene that represents those pieces.

However, the player is the only one affected by the rearrangement of the timeline. Other entities, like the serial killer move through the timeline in its original order.

#### Implementation

As the lead programmer for this project, I'm the one who decides the implementation details for each mechanic. One of the first questions I had was, just how many timeline pieces do we need? Obviously, we aren't sure at this point, so I thought it would be interesting to generate the timeline using a procedural mesh for each timeline piece. By doing this, we wouldn't have to worry ourselves about the size of each piece because the dimensions can be set and modified at runtime.

The dimensions of each piece are determined by three variables, `angle size`, `depth`, and `height`. The angle size is determined by the number of pieces in the timeline. For instance, if there are only three pieces in the timeline, then each piece has an angle size of `120Â°` because `360 / 3 = 120`. The depth controls how long each piece is and the height controls how tall it is.

Heres a code snippet of the `AddLast` method of the timeline, which adds a timeline piece to the end of the timeline.

{% highlight csharp %}
public TimelinePiece.TimelinePiece AddLast() {
    var piece = this.timelinePieceFactory.Spawn(
        this.UniformSectorDepth,
        this.UniformSectorHeight,
        this.NumberOfTimelinePieces + 1);
    this.timelinePieces.AddLast(piece);
    return piece;
}
{% endhighlight %}
We are passing `NumberOfTimelinePieces` to the spawn method since it uses it to compute the `angle size` and are we also add `+1` because we are adding an additional piece to the timeline. The pieces of the timeline are stored in a `timelinePieces` which is a `LinkedList` because it is important to maintain the order of the pieces.

I also thought it would be interesting to make the pieces move and have the timeline slowly rotate when displayed to the player, just as an aesthetic effect. So i added a couple more settings that control the radius of the pieces that range from a minimum and maximum value. The radius is controlled by a pulsation rate and we also sort an additional setting that controls how fast the timeline rotates in degrees.

An example of what some of the settings look like.

![Timeline-Example]({{ "/assets/timeline-example.gif" | absolute_url }})

A small example of what it looks like in game.

Now of course, we also need to implement the rearrangement part of the timeline, otherwise its useless. To do this, we cast a ray whenever the player presses the left mouse button down. If it intersects a piece, then it gets picked up by the player. This allows the player to drag it over another piece and swap the two.

Heres the code for picking up the piece

{% highlight csharp %}
public void FixedTick() {
    if (this.pickedUpPiece.Piece != null && Input.GetMouseButton(0)) {
        var v3 = Input.mousePosition;
        v3.z = 7.5f;
        v3 = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(v3);
        this.pickedUpPiece.Piece.Sector.Transform.position = v3;
    }
    if (!Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0) || this.pickedUpPiece.Piece != null) {
        return;
    }
    var ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
    RaycastHit hit;
    if (Physics.Raycast(
            ray,
            out hit,
            100.0f,
            LayerMask.GetMask(LayerMask.LayerToName(TimelinePiece.TimelinePiece.DefaultLayer)))
                && hit.transform.gameObject.CompareTag(this.tag)) {
        this.pickedUpPiece.Piece = this.timeline.DeactivatePiece(hit.transform.gameObject);
        hit.transform.gameObject.layer = 2;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
The first `if-statement` elevates the piece so it looks like it is being picked up. The second `if-statement` breaks the execution if we aren't pressing our left mouse button down or there is already a piece picked up. The last section performs a raycast that detects timeline pieces only. If we hit a piece, then we deactivate it from the timeline and set its raycast layer to `2` (ignore raycast layer) because we don't want this piece to block the raycast onto the piece were swapping it with.

For now, when the pieces are swapped, we just swap the colors of the piece to prove that it works. Lets see what that looks like.
![Timeline-Swap]({{ "/assets/timeline-swap.gif" | absolute_url }})

#### Remarks
In hindsight, I think I made a design error because I don't think a procedural mesh will work out in the long run. Right now each piece looks like a pizza slice but the goal is to make it more like piece in the timeline drawing. Doing this would require more work trying to figure out where the vertices should be. It's also not very viable because I have to calculate the uv's coordinates, which can be quite cumbersome. 

It is very likely we will just end up importing a model for the piece and this will act as a placeholder for now. A model will also be able to have a higher number of faces, which will make the piece look more aesthetically pleasing. The rotation of the timeline and pulsation will most likely stay.

### Player Movement

The type of gameplay we decided on was a point and click game. This mean we have a player object that moves across the screen against a 2D background. The implementation is a little tricky because we also want to give the illusion of depth by allowing the character to move in two axes. If this is a little confusing, keep reading.

The first thing I did was implement a very simple class that allows me to project my mouse position onto a plane. The projected position is where I tell the player object to move to.

Lets look at the code for that.

{% highlight csharp %}
public void FixedTick() {
    var dir = (this.lastHit.point - Camera.main.transform.position).normalized;
    Debug.DrawRay(
        Camera.main.transform.position,
        dir * Vector3.Distance(Camera.main.transform.position, this.lastHit.point),
        Color.red);
    if (!Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) {
        return;
    }
    var ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
    if (!Physics.Raycast(ray, out this.lastHit, 100.0f)) {
        return;
    }
    this.movementCoroutine?.Dispose();
    this.movementCoroutine = this.MoveTo(this.lastHit.point, 0.5f).ToObservable().Subscribe();
}
{% endhighlight %}
Basically, this code starts a coroutine to move the player whenever the a ray hits the plane. The coroutine is started using a library called [UniRX](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx#using-with-ienumerators-coroutines), and using this library gives me a higher level api to manage coroutines and other reactive features.

Heres the coroutines code.

{% highlight csharp %}
private IEnumerator MoveTo(Vector3 target, float minimumDistance) {
    while (Vector3.Distance(this.componentSettings.Transform.position, target) > minimumDistance) {
        this.componentSettings.Transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(
            this.componentSettings.Transform.position,
            new Vector3(target.x, this.componentSettings.Transform.position.y, target.z),
            this.movementSettings.Speed * Time.deltaTime);
        yield return new WaitForFixedUpdate();
    }
    yield break;
}
{% endhighlight %}
Pretty self explanatory. It move the player to the targeted located every fixed frame until it reaches the minimum distance or we dispose it, like we did in the `FixedTick` method.

Now lets see it in action.

Next, lets add the scene background and see if we can create the illusion of depth. Here's what that looks like.


![Player-Movement-Wide]({{ "/assets/player-movement-wide.gif" | absolute_url }})

Note: It's semi transparent so we can easily see where the walkable area is.

Well it works, but we have a bit of a problem. As the character gets farther and farther to the side of the screen, he starts to move a lot slower. This has to do with how the ray is being projected on the screen. If you look at the ray in the scene view, you can see how the length of the ray increases as we move farther to the side of the screen. This means our character has to travel a farther distance to cover the same amount of ground, causing him to move slower from our perspective.

Perhaps if we tried changing the camera's field of view, the ray won't have to travel as far. 

Lets take a look at that.
![Player-Movement-Wide]({{ "/assets/player-movement-90FOV.gif" | absolute_url }})

Great! With a field of view of `90Â°`, we now get much smoother movement and the movement speed is discrepancy is only really noticeable on the very far edges.

We seem to have another problem though. Our character is changing in size far too quickly when moving from front to back. This is quite unrealistic because he is only moving a very short distance from our point of view.

So now we really need to find a balance between scaling the character properly and creating smooth movement. What I am planning to do is to make the character's scale a function of the character's `Z` position and his movement speed as a function of his `X` position. 

To put it more simply, the character will increase in scale as he moves further back and will move faster in world space as he approaches the side of the scene.

Stay tuned next week for more!
